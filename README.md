100daysofCode

Python is a great language for beginners.
-It's easy to learn
-Has an active supportive community
-Offers versatile opportunities in web development, games, data science.

**Day1_100days** is about Print Statements
You just learned your first command: the print statement. It says "Print out whatever's in my brackets". The print statement is how you get your program to put messages in the console.
The "" (quotes) are used to tell the command that you're putting text in there (any text you want)
A bunch of text (or whatever you put in quotes) is called a string.
ðŸ‘‰ Use the triple quote """ if you want to write a big chunk of text with gaps or line breaks. Add this code to what you have in main.py and hit run.

**Day2_100days** is about Taking user input
Input: Let's take a look at the input command and how that works. Input is when the user gives information to the computer.
input("What's your name?: ")

It's very similar to the print command, except that it'll show the message in the console then wait until the user has typed something into the console and pressed enter.

Variables: input asks for something, takes it, but then has nowhere to put it. We can change that with a variable which is a value that we can use to name and store data. (Remember, David's box for David's phone?)

myName = input("What's you name? ")
myAge = input("How old are you? ")

Naming variables
You can give a variable any name you want, but you can't use spaces. You can use:

-underscores_between_words

-camelCaseToMakeItEasierToRead

Printing a Variable: You can print your variable using print and the name you used for your variable in your input command. Remember the three variables we just created: myName, myAge and replit?

In your code you can now print 'name' by using print(myName) or 'age' by using print(myAge).

Syntax Error

ðŸ‘‰ What is wrong with the code below? Copy the code only (not the error message) and hit run.

my variable = input("WHO GOES THERE? ")

print(my variable)

Did you notice the space in the variable name? We never put spaces in variable names - it just confuses the poor computer!

**Day3_100days** is about Concatenate
All it really means is combine text (remember, text is called a string) and variables together into single sentences! ðŸ˜²ðŸ¤¯
You can make your input and output look super pretty now! ðŸ¥³
